Now with Chrome support ;-)

print your personal comments for geocaches on geocaching.com. Moreover, you can mark final locations of caches on 
the map.

About the folders...
- src is the main source folder.
- The opera & dist folder have been a try to support opera as well. This has not been investigated further after v69.
